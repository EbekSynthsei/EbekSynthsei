<h4>To write about yourself is always a pain, so I'll redirect you to my <a href = "https://linktr.ee/EbekSynhtsei">linktree</a>, choose a direction and discover who I am by yourself.</h4>

Don't spam me please, but <i>don't be shy to contact me</i> on whatever you wanna talk about.

If it's important send me a mail, I'll answer faster.
<h3>Have a nice day!</h3>
